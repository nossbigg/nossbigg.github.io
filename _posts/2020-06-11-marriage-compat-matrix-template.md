# Purpose

- Having a relationship with a good fit for both sides provides the best chance of a successful marriage.

- A good fit should tick both logical and emotional boxes; using solely one aspect is ill-advised.

- Use this template to list out all the factors (pros/cons) about how well does your partner fit into your life (present and future).

| Lifestyle       |        |
| Financials      |        |
| Relational      |        |
| Long-term Goals |        |
| Others          |        |

# Conflict Resolution Strategies

_Q: What if there‚Äôs friction on a certain point?_

- **Adapt**

If it is possible to change the state of affairs to a new normal that is a viable long-term solution and does not cause as much pain, then that is optimal.

- **Accept**

If the pain point is minor (eg. nitpick) and does not hurt the relationship or either partner, then accepting the pain point is a valid strategy.

- **Abandon**

If the pain point(s) is causing too much friction or is a dealbreaker, then perhaps it is for the better for both parties not to proceed into marriage.

# Backstory

This template was organically formed as I was discerning the possibility of marriage with my partner. It contains the aggregated wisdom of multiple people of Godly counsel in my life, Thanks be to God üôÇ

I found this template useful for me, so I thought maybe it'd be useful for others. If you've found it useful, holla at me! üì¢

Cheers, and have a good one!
