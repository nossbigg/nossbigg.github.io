# Context

- Our team was tasked to create a **GrabFood-like web portal** to support **new business endeavors**
  - _Team composition: 2x Backend Engineer, 2x Fullstack Engineer, ~1-2x Fullstack engineers (sister team, periodic assistance)_
- I was granted the opportunity to be the **Frontend lead** for this project
- The project's requirements were very **Frontend-heavy**
- Due to a **persistent lack of engineering resources** and **my own professional inexperience**, we did not manage to deliver the project on time.

# Losses

1. I suffered an **abysmal performance rating**

   As we were unable to complete enough Frontend-specific features, I **bore the responsibility** for the failure to deliver on the project, and rightfully so, for:

   > A Tech Lead's core responsibility: To ensure the successful delivery of the team's technical goals that they have committed to.

1. **All my team members** (engineers, managers, PMs) took a **performance rating hit**

   As a direct consequence for the failure to deliver the project on time, **all my team members** (upstream and downstream), had a negative hit on their performance reviews.

1. I **bit off more than I could chew**, and paid **many personal costs**

   _Hindsight is 20/20_ - It is clear to me now that I had **grossly overstretched** myself:

   - I was constantly very stressed
   - I fell sick more often
   - I had troubles falling asleep
   - I became less present to my family and friends
   - I had neglected on my self-care routines
   - I became more irritable and less willing to help others

# Takeways

1. **Deliver within the business cycle** ‚è±

   As most company processes are synchronized to time periods (eg. Quarterly Business Reviews, Biannual Performance Reviews), it is **absolutely critical** that projects are delivered within the target business cycle, so that:

   - **Business** is happy: They get to see their **business ideas in action** and perhaps even **reap big monetary/strategic gains** for the company.
   - **Managers** are happy: They get to show that their team **delivered on their commitments** to business.
   - **Engineers** are happy: They get to **receive technical credit** for making the business idea happen.

    <br/>
   So, yes, <span style="color:red"><b><u>do your absolute damnedest</u></b></span> in your ability to deliver the project on time! üß®

   Alas, here's another perspective: If the project **fails under your watch**, it's not just you that takes a hit - **all your other teammates take a hit too!** [_No pressure._](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/189279) _(nervous sweating)_ üòÖ

1. **Seek qualified advice** for your unknown unknowns üí°

   - As Software Engineers, it is far more often that not that we encounter _something new_.
   - It's good to **run your technical approaches** with someone that is **more technically capable**, especially if it's an area that you're not that strong in.
   - If there's **something wrong**, take the opportunity to **learn** and to **improve** your technical capabilities, for:
     > "There shouldn't be any shame in getting it wrong the first time round."
   - If there's **nothing wrong**, take the opportunity to **validate your knowledge** against someone else with stronger capabilities.
   - Additionally, you can also take these avenues to **build rapport** with other engineers within the firm, especially if you're in a large firm (_things are usually impersonal across functional teams._)

1. Know which **battles not to fight** üõë

   - As a Lead Engineer for any project, one should perform a **risk analysis** (eg. ["SWOT analysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) for the project. The question that needs answering is:

   > "What are the delivery risks that this project faces?"

   - Examples of delivery risks:

     - Insufficient engineering capacity
     - Scope creep
     - Unrealistic timelines
     - Poor technical stewardship
     - Declining team morale
     - _See more_: [PMI: Seven causes of project failure](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/seven-causes-project-failure-initiate-recovery-7195), [SourceMaking: Project Management AntiPatterns](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/software-project-management-antipatterns)

   - In normal BAU (ie. _Business as usual_) circumstances, we **discover** and **proactively mitigate** any project risks (eg. managing expectations, providing more technical leadership, acquiring more team members) - We should **not quit** prematurely; we should **overcome** difficult situations.
   - However, should the odds be **so obviously stacked against the team** (eg. unrealistically short timelines), then perhaps it would be wise <span style="color:red"><b><u>not to accept the project at all</u></b></span>.

   The **crux** of the matter is this:

   > "Do everything in your power to ensure that the odds are stacked in your favour."

   _Note: At all times, do only what is ethical, legal, and honorable. Don't be evil._

# _Epilogue_

#### _The Baptism by Fire_

As we **scale new heights and challenges**, it is almost a given that there will be a <u><b>baptism by fire</b></u> for every major milestone:

- First time leading an **Epic**: Will I be able to **design** and **execute** the technical approach for a subsystem?
- First time being a **senior engineer**: Will I be able to be a **good mentor** to my juniors in my team?
- First time **leading a team**: Will I be able to provide sufficient **technical leadership** for my team?
- First time **handling an entire project**: Will I be able to **successfully deliver** on this project?

No risk, no reward; But **high risk != high reward**; So, take **calculated risks** üòÖ

#### _The Acceptance of the Loss_

You won't always _pull it off_ nicely on the first go, so...

- **Accept that things can go sideways**, and when they do, you'll just have to [_"take an L"_](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=take%20an%20L) and move on ü§ïüò¢
- Sometimes the losses can be pretty **hard-hitting**, so **go easy on yourself**, especially if the situation isn't going easy on you
- Be **patient with yourself**: Processing through the [5 Stages of Grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief) can sometimes **take longer than expected**, depending on the severity of the setback
- Remember to **take time off to process and recover** - Do the work, but also **do the [Self-care](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/201812/self-care-12-ways-take-better-care-yourself)** too!
- Make sure you've **recovered emotionally** - We are humans, not machines. Yes, it applies to both women and men.
- (_After you've recovered..._) Take time to **reflect** as to **how and why things went wrong**, and how you can **make things better** the next time round

#### _The Call to Responsibility_

_Taking responsibility_ **shouldn't just be a matter of barter trading it for good performance reviews**. Nor should it be merely as a means to strong-arm your way into getting your own way with others.

Instead, I would like to _humbly submit_ to you this proposal:

> As a leader, how we can better **serve others** through our **responsibility**?

- As a **Technical Lead** to my team, how can I be more **available** to my **junior teammates** to help them with their questions, both big and small?
- As a **Senior Engineer**, how can I be more **available** to **help other engineers** _within_ and _outside_ of my company?
- As a **Project Lead**, how can I better communicate my **team's technical difficulties** to my managers?
- As a fellow **Colleague**, how can I be **attentive** and **caring** to my colleagues, especially those who are in distress?

#### Appendix: Wins

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See more</summary>

1. I was able to **navigate** and **provide technical leadership** through most of the project's technical difficulties
   - eg. Proofs-of-Concepts, Cloud architecture, Frontend architecture, Component design
1. I was able to meet most of the **technical requirements of external stakeholders**
   - eg. OAuth Integration, Analytics, Internal CMS
1. I was able to perform the **team project management** role
   - eg. Sprint planning, ask estimation, task breakdown

All in all, I'm happy that I was able to **fulfill most of the responsibilities** of the Frontend lead role - It was most certainly not _a walk in the park_ üò™.

**Thank God** ‚úùÔ∏è that I made it through, and that I was able to rise to the occasion! üôè

PS: _I think this section didn't quite fit into the post's overall core themes; I'm leaving this here in the appendix as, after all, it is good to recognize and celebrate our wins._ üòå
