# Prologue

<i><sup>4</sup> But the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not surely die.</i> 

<i><sup>5</sup> For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äù</i>

Having `react-script eject`-ed ourselves from the Eden of `create-react-app`, here's a few tips on how to speed up your Frontend Typescript builds! üôÉüêë 

# Tips

#### 1. Profile your webpack `build` using `speed-measure-webpack-plugin` (or equivalent)

- Use `speed-measure-webpack-plugin` to get insight into the webpack `build` step.
- Tackle the loaders/plugins that take the longest times (if possible)

#### 2. Remove `eslint-loader` (or equivalent) during webpack dev/prd build steps

- Linters can slow down your build times significantly once your project becomes sufficiently large.
- This is especially painful for developers, as:
```
longer build times = longer feedback loops = less productivity
```
- Do the linting elsewhere - eg. `git hooks` or `CI stages` - instead of slowing down the build with a linter.

_Example: `package.json`: pre-commit linting via `husky` git hooks + `eslint`_
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'"
    },
    "husky": {
        "hooks": {
            "pre-commit": "yarn lint"
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Diagnose `tsc`

- Use `tsc -diagnostics` to get insight into the `tsc` compile step
- Use `tsc --listFiles` to see what files `tsc` is using for the compile step
- If there are extra files that aren't required for the build, tweak the `files`/`include`/`exclude` properties in `tsconfig.json` to see if you can exclude these files, as:

```
Fewer files = less code to transpile = shorter build times
```

_Example: `tsconfig.json`: Include all source files but exclude all tests (ie. `*.spec.ts`) (reference: official documentation)_
```json
{
    "include": [
        "src/**/*"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "**/*.spec.ts"
    ]
}
```

#### 4. Try other TypeScript loaders

- Try switching to other TypeScript loaders to see if you can get faster build times.
- My colleague swapped out `awesome-typescript-loader` with `ts-loader` for our project, and that alone **halved** the build time!
- Don't forget to look into the configuration settings the loader that you're using to squeeze more time savings out from it.

_Example: Configuration for `awesome-typescript-loader`_
```json
{
    "useCache": true,
    "forceIsolatedModules": true,
    "transpileOnly": true
}
```

- `awesome-typescript-loader` [(link)](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader)

#### 5. Use Babel to transpile your entire project

- Since Babel 7, Babel is able to natively transpile TypeScript into JavaScript.
- You can experiment with a Babel-first approach to building your project (instead of `tsc` as the usual default for TypeScript projects)
- To do this, just remove your existing TypeScript loader and configure `babel-loader` to read your `.ts/.tsx` files.

_Example: `webpack.config.js`: `babel-loader` accepting `.tsx` files (reference: [react-scripts's `webpack.config.js`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js))_
```javascript
{
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
              test: /\.(js|mjs|jsx|ts|tsx)$/,
              include: paths.appSrc,
              loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

- Caveat: Babel **won't** typecheck your code, so it's prudent to 'typecheck' the project.

_Example: `package.json`: `typecheck` script_
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
    }
}
```
