# What I needed answers for:
> "_In a massively distributed and concurrent systems scenario, how can one use databases (SQL/NoSQL) in a performant manner and yet still preserve data integrity/correctness?_"

# Key points:
- Traditional SQL databases are ‚Äò**bundled**‚Äô (ie. transactions, locks, indexes, joins, foreign key constraints, MVCC, etc)
- You can ‚Äò**unbundle** the database‚Äô in order to get more performance out of systems, but there are caveats
- ‚ÄòUnbundling the database‚Äô means that you‚Äôll have to build all the system guarantees that comes with ‚Äòbundled‚Äô databases by yourself
- General principles of building ‚Äòunbundled‚Äô systems
  - Using systems that rely on write-ahead-log (WAL) (eg. Kafka)
  - Design systems to be idempotent (ie. the side effect of an action is guaranteed to be executed only once, even if you repeat the execution of the given action)
  - Increase system throughput by increasing partitions, instead of using coordination (eg. 2PC) or consensus-based (eg. Paxos) techniques
  - Determine the constraints of the system
    - Eg. Unique username required?
    - Eg. Same business event should only occur at most once per day?
  - Determine the required correctness 
    - Ok to sometimes drop events? (eg. analytics systems)
    - Ok to process events out-of-order?
    - Ok to have duplicate events?
  - Use event IDs to dedupe events
- Systems are composed of state and application, ie. database and code
- Systems can be synchronous (eg. request/response) or asynchronous (eg. subscribing to events)
- Start to think of systems in a dataflow paradigm (eg. when someone messages you, data flows asynchronously from the other person‚Äôs phone to the server, and then you receive the message via a socket)

# Why this book‚Äôs awesome:
- Solid suggestions on how to make scalable data systems ‚úÖ (especially Chapter 12, _Unbundling Databases_, and _Aiming For Correctness_üéñüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§Ø)
- Effective presentation of pertinent concepts about distributed and concurrent systems 
- Plenty of cross-references (note: a _boatload_ of them!) for you to learn (even) more about data systems
  - Eg. [Pat Helland and David Campbell. Building on quicksand](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1788)
- Beautiful illustrations at the start of every chapter

# Tips on how to approach this book
- Best way to let this book hold your attention is to start with the Index and the Summary
- Mark out what catches your eye and focus on those things

# Closing thoughts:
- I concur with Kevin Scott‚Äôs glowing endorsement of the book: 

> ‚ÄúThis book should be required reading for software engineers‚Ä¶‚Äù - Kevin Scott
 
- As software engineers, the applications that we build principally consists of two things: `state` and `application code`. 
- This book is a great introduction on how to handle data at rest (eg. databases), data at motion (eg. event streams), and the general principles on how to do both at scale.
