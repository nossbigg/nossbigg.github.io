# Why I did the certification

While I was able to put pieces of software together in a local environment (eg. `postgres`, `mongo`, `redis`), I wasn't very confident (at all) in being able to do the same thing on the cloud.

# Why you should do it too

> "It's essentially the definitive System Design interview prep!"

- If you've never taken a cloud certificate before, the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) will equip you with the **skills and knowledge** to use AWS's core cloud services!
- If you're a junior developer, this is _probably_ the **fastest** way to learn cloud infrastructure üöÄ
- _Alternative value proposition_: With this certification, you'll be more than well-prepared for the System Design interview. _It's that good!_

_\*Note: Equivalent certificates from other cloud providers (eg. GCP, Azure) would be equally effective too üëç_

# Best way to prepare for it

**1. Use a structured course**

- Trying to study for any certification using only the [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) is a _fool's errand_ - There are simply too many products and too much details within the docs to do so effectively.
- The more effective way is to leverage on a **structured course**, where instructors have outlined only the **necessary areas** required for a given certification.

Structured courses:

- [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/) by Stephane Maarek ([/r/AWSCertifications/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/)'s favourite lol)
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C02](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) by A Cloud Guru (also available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/))
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - 2020 [SAA-C02]](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-hands-on-labs/) by Neal Davis
- [AWS Developer Associate Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pass-the-aws-developer-associate-exam-with-this-free-16-hour-course/) by freeCodeCamp

**2. Do (many) prep tests**

- **Don't skimp** on prep tests!
- There are plenty of AWS prep tests available online, most of which are cost-effective too. (_heck, you probably earn enough per hour to pay for each test after taking your lunch break lol_ üôà)
- Prep tests help to fill in the gaps on **missing areas** of knowledge, and also builds **endurance** for taking long tests.

Prep tests:

- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02/) by Jon Bonso
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-tests/) by A Cloud Guru
- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 500 Practice Exam Questions](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c/) by Neal Davis
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C01) Prep](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-csaa-c01-prep/) by Whizlabs
- [SAA-002 Practice Test](https://www.aws.training/certification?banner=exam-prep) by AWS

**3. Use excellent peripheral resources**

There's a **LOT** of AWS materials online. Of the lot, here's the resources that I found to be great prep resources:

- [AWS Cheat Sheets](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/) by Tutorials Dojo - for **succinct product-level summaries** and **comparing product feature sets**
- [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) - for **deep dives** and **authoritative answers**
- [A Cloud Guru Forums](https://acloud.guru/forums) - for **practice test-related questions**
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=aws) - this needs no introduction üôÉ
- [The Amazon Builder's Library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library) - for a **technical-first top-down use case-driven** architecture design approach
- [AWS Whitepapers & Guides](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers) - for a mix of **academic-first/business-first solutioning** approach
- (_Whatever useful information that Google searches would yield for you_ üòâ)

- It's okay to not complete your exam prep as fast as others.
- It's okay to find the materials difficult.
- It's okay to spend more time doing prep tests to build confidence.

Some people just have spent more time with cloud infrastructure.

I, too, was demoralized when my colleague (a Backend Engineer) passed the exam with only 1 month of prep. Understandably, I took longer to prepare for the exam, since most of my experience was in the frontend space.

All the best, and may your efforts be fruitful üçá üôÇ
